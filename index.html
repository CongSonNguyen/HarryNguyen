                <h3 class="major">The Beginning of Coding Passion</h3>
								<p>I loved computer when I was a little boy. Understanding that, my dad bought me a computer when I was 9 years old and my passion for computer began from there. I did a lot of things with my pc such as watching movies, playing games, did whatever people usually do on computer and I loved it. However, there was one thing I was always wondering was how people interacted with a box of full of electronic so easily what was behind that interface and I soon found out the answer for my own ‘coding’. I coded my first program on Pascal, a simple ‘Hello’ program when I was at sixth grade and it was a fun experience. I developed my skill in programming gradually from school to home and my dad has always been my inspiration>.</p>
                <h3 class="major">RMIT Path</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/RMIT1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>There were so many reasons why I chose RMIT. The first and also the biggest reason is the teaching quality there. Flashback to 2015 when I still was a high-school student, I had a chance to visit and be a student in RMIT campus in Vietnam. I was surpriesed by the teaching program and the enthusiasm of the teacher. Secondly, my sister finished her Bachelor in RMIT and was able to find an ideal job after she graduated, and so I believe RMIT is the right place to be. Last but not lease, the central location of RMIT is pretty convenient for me to travel to.</p>
								<p> There are several things I want to master during my time RMIT. Firstly, I want to learn and improve my soft skills such as communication skills, problem solving, collaboration, research, and many more. I believe these transferable skills are just as important as technical skills that every single person in this IT field need to have to become a part of a team and a company. Secondly, I believe 3 years in university is the best time to learn and improve technical programming skills. In order to customize myself, most-used programming and database languages</p>

								<h2 class="major">Personal Profile</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pp.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The questions that was given me I honestly answered and I feel that the results truly show who I am as a person, there might be few areas where I may require to change yet these minor changes won’t affect me as a person, my characteristics that led me to this moment will keep evolving and that the results is just an indication of who I am as a person.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pp4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>            The Myers-Bridge </p>
								<p>The results show that I am slightly extrovert over introvert meaning I do understand that there are others around me and acknowledge that they are there to take part within a team, my opinions may be based on feelings yet they will be brought forward to the team as a form of understanding and hope that with that opinion it can be developed and shaped to a common understanding with the team. My openness towards the team will greatly benefit with decision making as I’ll be happy to take and receive critic and opinions of others. My agreeableness shows how I would put myself second and others first to listen and understand, afterwards I can present my ideas based upon others opinions and mine.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pp1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> When forming a team or being a part of a team, I will look at what I need to adapt with to have harmony between the team members as everyone would have different results. With these results it shows how I can adapt myself towards a team and also make myself heard, contributing to opinions and developing ideas as a team. I believe that myself as a person will provide greatly with a team and If i had to choose i’d choose people that would also be able to adapt to my personally as an extrovert, being open and also agreeing with others opinions. </p>

								<h2 class="major">HoloStudy</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/hl2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> Since the holographic technology has been introduced in 1971, Very few apps and practices have been done so far. As i understand the huge potential of this futuristic technology in many fields especially education, the ‘holostudy’ was born. The project will focus on developing apps for the hardware ‘hololens’, and then equip it to all classes. Holostudy will help student to interact with holograms within a small environment such as labs, lecture halls. There will be no more paradigm education but 3-D graphic and animation instead which will enhance teaching quality and student engagement during class time. </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/hl1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>It is absolutely true that the future of the world is in my classroom today and that is the reason why I want to make holostudy reality. Holograms can bring tons of opportunities for students. For instance, when students learn about human biology, instead of viewing it on 2-D screen, holograms can bring the entire human cardiovascular system to real life and so students can walk around and explore them in detail. Biological study is just one of many fields that can be applied holograms. When it comes to concepts that are too small, too complex, or too abstract that students cannot understand by reading, holograms can visualize it and make it easy to understand. Holostudy is the future learning style. </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/hl3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The hololens now enable teachers to bring any concepts to mixed reality (MR). Mix reality a.k.a MR is the world where digital world combined with the real world. When students wear hololens, they will see the same 3D holograms as what their teacher seeing . This feature create a lot of opportunities for interaction and collaboration between students and teachers and It makes learning more interesting and attractive therefore more effective. However, there will be a set of apps that need to be developed in order to prepare holographic lessons. </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/hl4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p> HoloStudy contains three components </p>
								<ul>
									<li>Hololens (Hardware): Hololens is a headset that enables users to see and interact with holograms within the small to medium area such as classes, labs. No wires, no phone required, hololens has its own built-in computer, so you can walk around freely. </li>
									<li>Operating System: Considered hololens is a computer, it needs an operating system like other computers. The window interface will be designed for this hololens, so users can interact with the system like they interact with normal computers.</li>
									<li>Apps: There will be apps for hololens just like app for iPhone or Android </li>
								</ul>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/hl5.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>If the holostudy project is successfully put into practice, we will have the entirely new teaching and learning method that we can go beyond the screen. Teachers will interact with students through holograms, a complete new way to visualize studies which can not be described by writing. With holostudy, students will have a better understanding of twhat they are learning and also their interest in learning will be greatly enhanced </p>
